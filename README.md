##Offline Signature Recognition and Verification

This is a Python-OpenCV implementation of a system that does offline signature recognition and verification.

###The paper
For a similar system you can look at the following paper:    
"Off-line arabic signature recognition and verification", M.A. Ismail, Samia Gad - Pattern Recognition (2000) Elsevier

###Signature data
I had no hope getting access to the data the Mr. Ismail used in his paper. So I started to search on the internet for some data and I found some puplically available on <http://sigcomp09.arsforensica.org/NISDCC-preview/>. There is a collection of 60 authentic signatures form 12 peoples, And 151 forged version for each persons signiture.

All those data are located on `data` directory.
